# *Clinical Management System*
This project aims to develop a web application for a health center's clinical management system. The main features include:

1. Appointment Booking: Patients can search for and select doctors based on their specialization.

2. Appointment Confirmation: Once the appointment is confirmed, a bill is generated.

3. Doctor Consultation: Patients can meet the doctor at the booked time and receive medicine and advice.

## *User Interface Design*
I designed the user interfaces using Figma, following a specific color palette to maintain a consistent and professional look.

## *ER_diagram and Relationship mapping*
Addionally, I created an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram and mapped the relationships for this system.
